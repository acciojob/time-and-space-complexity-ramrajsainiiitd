		Time and Space Complexity
	</h1>
<p>
In theoretical computer science, the Time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. lesser the time taken, lesser the time complexity and more efficient the algorithms
</p>
	<p>
<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity. However, people frequently confuse Space-complexity with auxiliary space	
	if the program take array of narural number its space complexity should be O(n). </p>
