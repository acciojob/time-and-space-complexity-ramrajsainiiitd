		Time and Space Complexity
	</h1>
<p>
In theoretical computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.</p>
	<p>
<b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity. However, people frequently confuse Space-complexity with auxiliary space	</p>
