		Time and Space Complexity
	</h1>
<p>
	Time Complexity is amount of time taken by the computers or machine to compute any algorithms. Lesser the time complexity more efficient the algorithms. 
</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> is total amount of space used by an algoriths. O(n) complexity is more efficient.
